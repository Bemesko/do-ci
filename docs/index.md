# DO/CI

This is sort of a blog/learning journal I'm making to help me turn my studies of infrastructure and DevOps into deliverables (in this case blog posts and cheatsheets), since they can't be as easily translated into commits and I need some tangible form of progress to keep me going with my study habits.

I expect the structure and deployment strategy of this blog to keep changing overtime, but for this first iteration I wanted to make it as minimal as possible, so I'm just using GitHub pages with a custom domain and cross-posting stuff into other platforms (namely my [Substack](https://dopci.substack.com/) and [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/Bmendoim) accounts)

## Current Posts

- (DRAFT) [Managing processes in Linux](process-linux.md)
- [Older stuff only on Substack](https://dopci.substack.com/)

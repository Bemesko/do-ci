# DO/CI
This repository is for DO/CI, a kind of blog-thing that I've been wanting to make for a while which will serve as a learning journal for me on my devops studies. Since putting a blog online also counts towards me knowing more about infrastructure I'll be slowly evolving this idea into a full blown website filled with fancy features (or not)

## Checklist

- [X] Search for static site generators such as Jekyll from GitHub pages
  - Jekyll
  - Gatsby
  - Next.js is also pretty widely used in my research
  - For now, go with the simple solution: markdown files in github pages
- [X] Generate blog posts from markdown files
- [X] Find a way to sustainably deploy this
- [ ] Choose a fitting Jekyll theme
- [ ] Set up HTTPS so the site doesn't look so sketchy

# Checklist

- [ ] Search for static site generators such as Jekyll from GitHub pages
- [ ] (Sadly) try to create a frontend template for the blog files (very minimal style because I'm lazy)
  - [ ] Bonus points if I manage to get it working fine on mobile too
- [ ] Generate blog posts from markdown files
- [ ] Find a way to sustainably deploy this
